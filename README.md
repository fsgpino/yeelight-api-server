# Yeelight API Server
API to remotely control the bulbs of the manufacturer yeelight.

*Warning: This API only works with the RGB mode.
The API has been tested with the color bulb models only.*

## Installation

It must be installed on a pc or raspberry pi with PHP 7.0 or higher.

The ```composer install``` command must be executed to install the dependencies.

It is necessary to expose the web folder in apache or nginx. Requests must be made to the ```api.php``` file.

## Settings
To begin its use it is recommended to edit the file config.inc.php (Inside the "includes" folder) and establish a unique secret token.

It is also possible to modify the default values and the connection timeout to the bulbs.

## Parameters
The API only supports the *POST* method and the parameters specified as *form-data*.
